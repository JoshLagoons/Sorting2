# Sorting2
THe use of linear search is being able to sequentially find each unit within the data set and it isn't as efficient as other options depending if the data set is small enough for it to be efficient. THe use of binary search needs a sorted data set in order for it to function and starts to compare each value in the middle of the data set and depending of the value being equal, it find the selected value. The interpolation search is a improvement to the binary because of how the values in the data set are uniformly set, from how the binary always does in the middle to scan, the interpolation goes to different locations based on the value its searching. Having a specific range to find the number needed.
